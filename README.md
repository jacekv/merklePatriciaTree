In order to understand Ethereum's core functionalities, I am implementing parts of it for myself. Here I am implementing
the Merkle Patrie Trie (MPT) purley in Python 3.

Passing tests :) 

Currently it does not pass tests where the test data consists of hex data and I am not sure why.

What is currently left to do?

 - ~~Fix the problem with the hex test cases~~ Done
 - ~~Comment the delete process~~ Done
 - Merkle proofs?
